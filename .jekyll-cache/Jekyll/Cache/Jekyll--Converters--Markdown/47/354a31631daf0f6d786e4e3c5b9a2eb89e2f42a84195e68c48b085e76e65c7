I"œ<p>Loose notes and bookmarks to fragments of PHP Roundtable panel on DDD with Mathias Verraes, Ross Tuck and Chris Fidao. Whole thing is about 2 hours long, so I decided to make some bookmarks in case I wanted to go back to it or reference it somebody. Unfortunatly I could not find the <a href="https://github.com/PHPRoundtable/show-notes/tree/master/episodes">shownotes or transcript for this episode</a>.</p>
